# Research-project-2020-DSBA

 This project is dedicated to customer analytics by unfiltered cutting data received from kidâ€™s online store given
 by SAS INSTITUTE. In order to form the most suitable proposal, it is necessary to do a number of works: building 
 analytical clustering (lifestyle - segmentation) using machine learning, identifying customer profiles based on purchases,
 the formation of a strategy to maintain the existing customer base through effectively built communications with customers 
 for each segment, the choice of the best personal offer for each profile (Next Best Offer). Within the project it is 
 necessary to allocate segments of clients which with the greatest probability will make the order in a category using
 results of the constructed mathematical models. Also, the project considers modern methods for detecting groups of goods 
 characterized by mutual influence on each other in terms of demand volume (Market Basket Analysis), using Machine Learning 
 methods and Financial and Economic analysis.
 
 Here you could find all intermediate tables and calculations, jypiter notebooks of implementation of DBSCAN algorithm, KMeans algorithm, 
 creating pivor tables and Analysis of variance.
